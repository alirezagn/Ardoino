# Arduino Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Arduino-based projects
developed and shared publicly under an open-source license. The goal is
to provide useful, easy-to-understand examples for hobbyists, students,
and makers who want to learn and build their own embedded systems.

## 📘 Overview

Each project in this repository includes: - Well-structured source
code - Circuit diagrams or wiring instructions - Explanation of
components used - Step-by-step setup and usage guide

All code is written using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO and is
compatible with common Arduino boards such as Arduino Uno, Mega, Nano,
and ESP-series boards depending on the project.

## 🔧 What's Inside

Projects may include: - Sensor integrations (temperature, humidity,
motion, light, etc.) - Motor control systems - LED and display modules -
IoT / network-ready examples - Power management and automation systems

Each project folder will contain:

    /project-name
      |- src/          # Source code a folder based on the project name. 
      |- schematics/   # Optional diagrams
      |- README.md     # Project-specific documentation
      |- LICENSE       # License file

## 🛠 Requirements

-   Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
-   Basic electronic components depending on the project
-   USB cable for uploading code
-   Optional: external libraries (noted per project)

## 📄 License

This repository is released under an open-source license. You are free
to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as you comply with the
terms of the included license.
